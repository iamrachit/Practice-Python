# Practice-Python

This repository is a collection of python concepts with easy-to-understand code examples including various methodologies used while coding in python.

## About Python

Its a open source programming language used to develop almost any kind of application including desktop application, web application, CAD, Image processing and etc. 

## Identifiers
The identifier is the given name to entities like class, functions, variables, modules and any other object in Python. Identifiers can be a combination of the letter in lowercase, uppercase, digits or an underscore. No special character except underscore is allowed in the name of a variable. 

## Reserved Words 
keyword or reserve word are those words which are already reserved by python, we can not use those words as an identifier like a variable

## Types of errors in python

1. Syntax Error - Syntaxes are rules of a language and when we break these rules, the error which occurs is called Syntax Error. Examples of Syntax Errors are Misspalled keywords, Incorrect use of an operator, Omitting parentheses in a     function call.

2. Runtime Error - It's a kind of error which occur while the program is running and as a result, the python interpreter halts the execution of the program and displays a message about the cause of the problem. They usually occur when an interpreter counters an operation that is impossible to carry out and one such operation is dividing a number by 0. Since dividing a number by 0 is undefined, when the interpreter encounters this operation it raises ZeroDivisionError as follows:
